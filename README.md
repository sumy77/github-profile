# React + TypeScript

React Js app fetching github profiles.

## Download & Build on local

```
Download the attached zip
cd github-profile
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
To run tests:
npm run test
```

Open your local browser and verify the sample-node-api is working by accessing:  
`http://localhost:5173/`

**Note**  
The `node_modules` folder will not be transferred, we can do npm install later on remote server itself to pull down required node packages. Node version used to build this application is node v20.2.0.

While fetching the profiles, only one profile is shown at a time in UI as per requirement given in screenshot, whereas user can see full search history in history tab.
